# PROJECT HALCYON SOFTWARE GUIDE

## Steps to use the web application : 

This web application works through a software MAMP.
So the prerequisites before running the web app would be to install MAMP. On installing all the PHP files can be added to the C drive on MAMP at htdocs . Similarly the SQL database can be added to MySQL by importing it to PhpMyAdmin tool. This can be done by localhost once MAMP is opened and set to run.
